## About me

I'm the student at USM (The State University of Moldova), faculty "Mathematics and Informatics", specialization "Applied Informatics".

What about my work expirience? For regret have it not so much...
My previous position was "Project Manager" into a IT company.
It was my first work expirience in IT, so, i consider that it was actualy well.

## Hobbies & Interests

My general interest are sport, literature, and... programming, yes. I think, that it's nice when your professional domain matches with your hobby, and you like what you do.

## Programing Languages

1. The main two languages I practice are Python and Java. I already have some projects, created with them, that you can also find at my GitHub.
In addition to the languages mentiones above, I have epirience working with JavaScript, C++, and  SQL.

2. Now I'm learning PHP, and diving into deep development with Java, specialy with Spring Framework.
I'm currently working at the development of secure application using Spring Security, and a part of this project you already can observe on coresponding repository. Or, might be at the moment you are reading this, it is already finished.

3. In the near future I plan to learn more about Data Analysis with Pandas (Python Framework), lear Kotlin and GO.
